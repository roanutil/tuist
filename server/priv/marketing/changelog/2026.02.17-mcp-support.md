Tuist now supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over HTTP so coding agents can authenticate and interact with your Tuist data directly.

This first release includes:

- OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration for MCP clients.
- A protected MCP endpoint at `/mcp` with proper bearer challenges.
- Initial tools for test analysis workflows:
  - `list_projects`
  - `list_test_cases` (with optional flaky filter)
  - `get_test_case`
  - `get_test_run`
  - `get_test_case_run`
- An initial prompt (`fix_flaky_test`) that guides agents through diagnosing and fixing flaky tests.

This gives agents enough context and tooling to inspect flaky tests and drill down into run-level failure details from Tuist.
